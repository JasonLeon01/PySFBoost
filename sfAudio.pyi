    Instead, the audio data is acquired continuously while the stream is playing. This behavior allows to play a sound with no loading delay, and keeps the memory consumption very low.

    Sound sources that need to be streamed are usually big files (compressed audio musics that would eat hundreds of MB in memory) or files that would take a lot of time to be received (sounds played over the network).

    sf::SoundStream is a base class that doesn't care about the stream source, which is left to the derived class. SFML provides a built-in specialization for big files (see sf::Music). No network stream source is provided, but you can write your own by combining this class with the network module.

    A derived class has to override two virtual functions:

    - onGetData fills a new chunk of audio data to be played
    - onSeek changes the current playing position in the source

    It is important to note that each SoundStream is played in its own separate thread, so that the streaming loop doesn't block the rest of the program. In particular, the onGetData and onSeek virtual functions may sometimes be called from this separate thread. It is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take care of synchronization issues if you share data between threads.

class SoundBuffer:
    """
    Storage for audio samples defining a sound.

    A sound buffer holds the data of a sound, which is an array of audio samples.

    A sample is a 16 bit signed integer that defines the amplitude of the sound at a given time. The sound is then reconstituted by playing these samples at a high rate (for example, 44100 samples per second is the standard rate used for playing CDs). In short, audio samples are like texture pixels, and a sf::SoundBuffer is similar to a sf::Texture.

    A sound buffer can be loaded from a file, from memory, from a custom stream (see sf::InputStream) or directly from an array of samples. It can also be saved back to a file.

    Sound buffers alone are not very useful: they hold the audio data but cannot be played. To do so, you need to use the sf::Sound class, which provides functions to play/pause/stop the sound as well as changing the way it is outputted (volume, pitch, 3D position, ...). This separation allows more flexibility and better performances: indeed a sf::SoundBuffer is a heavy resource, and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other side, a sf::Sound is a lightweight object, which can use the audio data of a sound buffer and change the way it is played without actually modifying that data. Note that it is also possible to bind several sf::Sound instances to the same sf::SoundBuffer.

    It is important to note that the sf::Sound instance doesn't copy the buffer that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it. Thus, a sf::SoundBuffer must not be destructed while it is used by a sf::Sound (i.e. never write a function that uses a local sf::SoundBuffer instance for loading a sound).

    When loading sound samples from an array, a channel map needs to be provided, which specifies the mapping of the position in the sample frame to the sound channel. For example when you have six samples in a frame and a 5.1 sound system, the channel map defines how each of those samples map to which speaker channel.

class SoundRecorder:
    """
    Abstract base class for capturing sound data.

    sf::SoundBuffer provides a simple interface to access the audio recording capabilities of the computer (the microphone).

    As an abstract base class, it only cares about capturing sound samples, the task of making something useful with them is left to the derived class. Note that SFML provides a built-in specialization for saving the captured data to a sound buffer (see sf::SoundBufferRecorder).

    A derived class has only one virtual function to override:

    - onProcessSamples provides the new chunks of audio samples while the capture happens

    Moreover, two additional virtual functions can be overridden as well if necessary:

    - onStart is called before the capture happens, to perform custom initializations
    - onStop is called after the capture ends, to perform custom cleanup

    The audio capture feature may not be supported or activated on every platform, thus it is recommended to check its availability with the isAvailable() function. If it returns false, then any attempt to use an audio recorder will fail.

    If you have multiple sound input devices connected to your computer (for example: microphone, external sound card, webcam mic, ...) you can get a list of all available devices through the getAvailableDevices() function. You can then select a device by calling setDevice() with the appropriate device. Otherwise the default capturing device will be used.

    By default the recording is in 16-bit mono. Using the setChannelCount method you can change the number of channels used by the audio capture device to record. Note that you have to decide whether you want to record in mono or stereo before starting the recording.

    It is important to note that the audio capture happens in a separate thread, so that it doesn't block the rest of the program. In particular, the onProcessSamples virtual function (but not onStart and not onStop) will be called from this separate thread. It is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take care of synchronization issues if you share data between threads. Another thing to bear in mind is that you must call stop() in the destructor of your derived class, so that the recording thread finishes before your object is destroyed.

This function uses its own thread so that it doesn't block the rest of the program while the capture runs. Please note that only one capture can happen at the same time. You can select which capture device will be used by passing the name to the setDevice() method. If none was selected before, the default capture device will be used. You can get a list of the names of all available capture devices by calling getAvailableDevices().

        Parameters
        - sampleRate	Desired capture rate, in number of samples per second

        Returns
        - true, if start of capture was successful
